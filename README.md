# CAPM

CAPM is a measurement of the expected return of investing in a share.

It is measured by the following formula:

CAPM(share)  = rf + β(share)(rm - rf)

rf is the expected return of investing in something with no risk e.g. government bonds.
rm is the expected return of investing in the overall market. This can be for example the expected return in investing in an index fund of the S&P500
β is a measure of the relative volativity of the share compared to the market.

In this project, I work out the CAPM of Apple shares. S&P500 is used as the rm.
